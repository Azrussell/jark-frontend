    <p>Whether you're an experienced programmer or a newbie, you're bound to run into a few bugs in your code from time to time. ChatGPT can help you narrow down the problem within your code, saving you hours looking for a misplaced comma. You can also write entire blocks of functional code snippets from scratch.

    Here are a few ways that we can use ChatGPY for programming and development purposes:
    </div>

    <div>
    <li>Generate code</li>
    <li>Complete and modify code</li>
    <li>Debug code</li>
    <li>Translate code from one language to another</li>
    <li>Explain codes in natural language</li>
    <li>Act as a Linux Terminal</li>
    <li>Act as an SQL command line</li>
    </div>

    Here is an example of Jark debugging code for us.
